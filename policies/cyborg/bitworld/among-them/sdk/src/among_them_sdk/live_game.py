"""``LiveGame`` runtime — connects an :class:`Agent` to a real Among Them server.

This is the "actually plays a game" runtime that the prompt asked for. Until
this module landed, the SDK only had :class:`LocalSim` (synthetic frames) and
:class:`RemoteServer` (a ``NotImplementedError`` stub). ``LiveGame`` speaks
the WebSocket wire protocol (binary 4-bit packed frames in, button-mask
packets out) and drives ``evidencebot_v2``'s FFI from real frames.

Design notes
------------

* Synchronous public surface — ``Agent.run(runtime=LiveGame(...))`` stays
  blocking like ``LocalSim`` so the existing examples still read top-to-bottom.
  Internally we run an asyncio loop on the calling thread; the event-loop
  scope is local to ``run`` so we don't poison anyone else's loop.
* One FFI step per frame, mask-on-change semantics. We mirror
  ``runBot`` in ``nottoodumb.nim``: receive frame → tick FFI → translate
  action index to ``TRAINABLE_MASKS[idx]`` → send only if the mask changed.
* No private SDK state intrudes on the FFI. We pass observations into
  ``EvidenceBotV2Policy.step_with_hooks`` exactly the same way ``LocalSim``
  does so the existing override hooks (``on_navigate``) still work.
* Best-effort transcript capture. The server doesn't emit structured event
  packets we can subscribe to, so we record what flows through *this*
  player's pipe: each chat string sent, the most recent action history, and
  the connection lifecycle. Vote target / kill target observations live
  inside the FFI bot and aren't surfaced via the current ABI — see the
  architectural note in :mod:`among_them_sdk.policy.evidencebot_v2`.

Phase 4 hooks (DESIGN.md §8) can extend this runtime to subscribe to
``/global`` for full-game telemetry and to ``/reward`` for live scores.
