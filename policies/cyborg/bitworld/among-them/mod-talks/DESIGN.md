# mod_talks — Design Report

A fork of `modulabot` that adds LLM-powered chatting and reasoning during
the voting phase. All perception, navigation, task, and evidence machinery is
inherited from modulabot unchanged. The divergence point is `voting.nim` and
`chat.nim`, where LLM calls augment the current rule-based chat templates
and evidence-based vote decisions.

**Status of LLM integration: shipped through Sprint 5.** The Nim state
machine, FFI surface, Anthropic Bedrock/direct Python wrapper, mock harness,
trace observability, concurrent dispatch, and prompt-eval pipeline are all
live behind the `-d:modTalksLlm` compile-time gate. Without the gate, builds
remain bit-for-bit identical to modulabot (parity 500/500 preserved).
Remaining work is tracked sprint-by-sprint in `LLM_SPRINTS.md`; high-level
status sits in §14.

The fastest read for new contributors is `README.md` (lobby setup +
build/run quickstart), then this file (architecture + design history),
then `LLM_VOTING.md` (LLM-layer detail), then `LLM_SPRINTS.md`
(implementation status checkboxes).

---

The sections below describe the inherited modulabot architecture verbatim.
§14 documents the LLM additions at high level; full design and per-call
context schemas live in `LLM_VOTING.md`.

This is a design doc. The original review pass resolved all 12 open
questions; their resolutions are baked into the body below and recorded in
§10 as a decisions log. §14 records open questions specific to the LLM
integration layer.

## 1. Goals & non-goals

### Goals

1. **Modular layout.** One concern per file; ~200–600 LOC each. No 4,700-line
   monoliths. Inherited from modulabot.
2. **Sub-record state.** Group `Bot`'s ~80 fields into ~10 named sub-records
   (`Perception`, `Motion`, `Tasks`, `Voting`, `Imposter`, ...). Each module
   owns the sub-record(s) it operates on. Inherited from modulabot.
3. **Strategy parity with modulabot at fork point.** mod_talks starts as a
   direct copy. All behavior is identical to modulabot until the LLM layer
   is added. We earn the right to diverge from modulabot's voting behavior
   only after the LLM integration is demonstrated to improve outcomes.
4. **Easy to extend.** Adding a new policy module (e.g. an alternate imposter
   playbook) should not require touching the perception layer. Inherited from
   modulabot.
5. **Same FFI shape, legacy prefix.** Exports `modulabot_new_policy` and
   `modulabot_step_batch` matching the existing batch/handle convention. The
   Python harness gains a new policy entry; existing nottoodumb/evidencebot
   and modulabot builds are untouched. *(Note: the original plan called for
   renaming the FFI prefix from `modulabot_` to `mod_talks_` once the LLM
   layer landed. Sprint 4.6 explicitly cancelled the rename — high-churn
   refactor across the Python wrapper, build script, exports, and tests for
   no behaviour change. Revisit only when a real name collision appears or
   a cogames submission demands it. The current state is internally
   consistent: `mod_talks` as project / directory / Python class name,
   `modulabot_*` as the legacy FFI prefix.)*
6. **LLM-powered chat and reasoning during voting (shipped).** During the
   voting phase, the LLM receives a structured context derived from
   `Memory`, `VotingState`, and visible chat lines, and returns either a
   vote target or a chat message. The Nim state machine (`llm.nim`) plus
   the Python wrapper (`cogames/amongthem_policy.py`) implement the design;
   §14 carries the high-level summary and `LLM_VOTING.md` carries the full
   per-call schemas.

### Non-goals (explicitly)

- **No new perception primitives.** Patch hashing, frame fit, ASCII OCR,
  sprite scanning all carry over verbatim from modulabot.
- **No abstraction over `sim.nim` or `protocol.nim`.** Those are upstream;
  mod_talks is a consumer. Same imports, same constants.
- **No build-system overhaul.** Reuse the same `build_nottoodumb.py`
  conventions and the same standalone-binary entrypoint shape.
- **No perception changes to earn the LLM integration.** The LLM receives
  the bot's existing belief state as context — it does not get raw frames or
  require new scan primitives.

**Why sub-folders for `viewer/` and `ffi/` but not for the main modules?**
The viewer and FFI layers are *replaceable surfaces* around a stable
`bot.nim` core; the directory boundary makes the gating visible and
discourages strategy code from accidentally depending on `silky/whisky/
windy` or FFI glue. The main modules stay flat under `players/modulabot/`
to match the rest of the repo (no `src/` convention exists at any other
level) and to keep relative imports short — `import ../../sim` from a flat
file is cleaner than `import ../../../sim` from a `src/` subdir.

## 3. State decomposition

### Current (`evidencebot_v2.nim:240-383`)

One flat `Bot` with ~80 fields spanning ~15 concerns. `initBot` is 50 lines
of hard-coded sentinel assignments. Field access is global (`bot.cameraX`,
`bot.imposterFolloweeColor`, `bot.voteChoices[ci]`).

### Proposed

`Bot` becomes a thin envelope holding sub-records and the few truly
cross-cutting scalars (`role`, `frameTick`, `rng`, `sim`, sprite refs).

**Conventions (Q4 + Q5 resolved):**

- **Leaf procs take explicit sub-record parameters.** Anything in the
  perception, motion, path, or evidence layer takes `var <SubRecord>` plus
  whatever read-only context it needs (`SimServer`, `Sprites`, `Perception`).
  This makes dependencies visible at the signature.
- **Orchestrators take `var Bot`.** That's `decideNextMask`,
  `decideCrewmateMask`, `decideImposterMask`, `decideVotingMask`,
  `stepUnpackedFrame*`. They sequence calls into the leaf procs.
- **Diagnostics is the one carve-out.** Procs that need to call `thought`,
  set `intent`, or stamp perf timers take `var Bot` even when they're
  otherwise leaf. This keeps `diag.nim` from infecting every signature with
  a `var Diag` parameter. The leaf-vs-orchestrator boundary moves slightly
  — `updateLocation` is technically a leaf, but it logs perf timers, so it
  takes `var Bot`. So be it.
- The orchestrator in `bot.nim` is the only place that pulls multiple
  policy modules together.
- Keep `role`, `isGhost`, `frameTick`, `sim`, `paths`, `rngs`, `sprites` at
  the top level — they're consumed by *every* module and pushing them down
  would just create indirection noise.
- Each sub-record gets an `init<Name>(): <Name>` proc in its owning module
  for clean construction (e.g. `initMotion()`, `initTasks(taskCount: int)`,
  `initRngStreams(masterSeed: int64)`). `initBot` becomes a composition of
  these calls.

### Trade-offs of this split

- **Wins:** every "where does this field live" question becomes obvious;
  mocking a sub-record in tests becomes trivial; cross-module coupling
  becomes a visible compile-time error rather than an invisible field-access
  pattern.
- **Costs:** every field access is now `bot.percep.cameraX` instead of
  `bot.cameraX`. Diff vs. v2 will be large at the syntax level even where
  logic is identical. Sub-record passing complicates a few deeply
  cross-cutting procs (e.g. `nearestTaskGoal` which wants `Perception`
  for camera, `Tasks` for state, `sim` for geometry). Mitigation: those few
  procs live in `bot.nim` or take `var Bot` directly.

Per-module summaries (succinct):

- **`tuning.nim`** — every magic number from the v2 const block, grouped by
  comment headers (`# Localization`, `# Tasks`, `# Imposter`). No procs.
- **`types.nim`** — every enum and small record (`PathNode`, `PathStep`,
  `CameraScore`, `IconMatch`, `CrewmateMatch`, etc.) plus the sub-record
  types and `Bot`. Imports `tuning`, `sim`. No procs.
- **`geometry.nim`** — `playerWorldX/Y`, `roomName(At)`, `taskCenter`,
  `cameraXForWorld`, `inMap`, `cameraIndex` family. Pure functions.
- **`frame.nim`** — `unpack4bpp`, `sampleColor`, the `ignore*Pixel` family
  collapsed to one generic `ignoreFromMatches[T](matches, sprite, sx, sy)`
  + thin wrappers. Plus `ignoreFramePixel` composition.
- **`ascii.nim`** — `asciiGlyphScore`, `findAsciiText`, `readAsciiLine`,
  `detectInterstitialText`, `isGameOverText`. Reusable for both interstitial
  detection and chat OCR.
- **`localize.nim`** — `buildPatchEntries`, `locateByPatches`,
  `locateNearFrame`, `locateByFrame`, `scoreCamera`, `updateLocation`. The
  one place mutating `Perception`'s camera fields.
- **`sprite_match.nim`** — `matchesSprite`, `maybeMatchesSprite`,
  `matchesSpriteShadowed`, `matchesActorSprite`, `actorColorIndex`. Used by
  `actors`, `tasks`, `voting`.
- **`actors.nim`** — `scanCrewmates`, `scanBodies`, `scanGhosts`,
  `updateRole`, `updateSelfColor`, `rememberRoleReveal`. Mutates
  `Perception.visible*` and `Identity`.
- **`tasks.nim`** — `scanTaskIcons`, `projectedTaskIcon`, `updateTaskGuesses`,
  `updateTaskIcons`, the `taskResolved` latch logic, `taskGoalReady`,
  `holdTaskAction`. Mutates `Tasks`.
- **`motion.nim`** — `updateMotionState`, `applyJiggle`, `axisMask`,
  `preciseAxisMask`, `coastDistance`, `shouldCoast`, `maskForWaypoint`.
- **`path.nim`** — `passable`, `findPath`, `reconstructPath`, `pathDistance`,
  `goalDistance`, `choosePathStep`. No mutation outside of locals.
- **`evidence.nim`** — `updateEvidence`, `evidenceBasedSuspect`,
  `randomInnocentColor`, `suspectedColor`. Mutates `Evidence`.
- **`chat.nim`** — `imposterBodyMessage`, `crewmateBodyMessage`,
  `bodyRoomMessage`, `queueBodySeen`, `queueBodyReport`. Mutates `ChatState`.
- **`voting.nim`** — `parseVotingScreen` plus the cursor-stepping decision
  logic and `decideVotingMask`. Mutates `VotingState`.
- **`policy_crew.nim`** — `decideCrewmateMask` (the part of `decideNextMask`
  that runs after the role branch); `nearestTaskGoal` and the eight-tier
  fallback. Reads everything; mutates `Goal` and `Tasks.taskHoldTicks`.
- **`policy_imp.nim`** — `decideImposterMask` and helpers
  (`pickFolloweeColor`, `maybeStartFakeTask`, `farthestFakeTargetIndexFrom`,
  self-report logic). Mutates `ImposterState` and `Goal`.
- **`bot.nim`** — `initBot`, `decideNextMask` (top-level dispatch only),
  `stepUnpackedFrame*`, `stepPackedFrame*`. Imports everything below it.
- **`diag.nim`** — `thought`, `intent` formatters, `inputMaskSummary`,
  `roleName`, `cameraLockName`. No business logic.

### Cycle hazards & how we break them

The current file uses a forward-decl block at v2:869–883 because localization
calls into sprite scanning which calls back. In the modular version:

- Localization (`localize.nim`) does **not** depend on `actors.nim`. It
  consumes `Perception.visible*` as already-populated state. The
  orchestrator in `bot.nim` runs `actors.scanAll(...)` *before*
  `localize.updateLocation(...)` so `ignoreFramePixel` has the matches it
  needs. (In v2 the order is the other way around — sprite scans run
  inside `updateLocation`. We invert it.)

  ⚠ **Open question — does the v2 ordering actually matter?** The current
  flow is "score with last-frame's sprite matches → re-localize → re-scan
  with new camera". Inverting could degrade scan quality on teleport. We may
  need a two-pass: cheap re-scan on new camera, then localize again. **Flag
  for parity testing.**

- `tasks.nim` consumes camera state from `Perception` but does not import
  `localize.nim`.

- `policy_*` modules read from everything below them but never import each
  other.

## 5. The per-frame pipeline

Reorganized around the sub-records. Functionally equivalent to v2:3831
*except* for the Q2-resolved scan ordering: sprite scans run before
localization using the previous frame's camera, with a re-scan after lock
if the camera jumped far enough that the first scan is unreliable.

```nim
# bot.nim — illustrative; final form will use plain procs, not method syntax

const TeleportThresholdPx = 32  # camera jump beyond this triggers re-scan

proc decideNextMask*(bot: var Bot): uint8 =
  # 1. Cheap interstitial gate first — never localize black screens.
  detectInterstitial(bot)         # sets bot.percep.interstitial + text
  if bot.percep.interstitial:
    parseRoleReveal(bot)          # only meaningful on IMPS / CREWMATE screens
    parseVotingScreen(bot)        # only meaningful on the vote screen
    updateMotionAfterInterstitial(bot.motion)
    clearGoal(bot.goal)
    snapshotPrevFrame(bot.percep) # mark prev as invalid (post-vote teleport)
    if bot.voting.voting:
      return decideVotingMask(bot)
    bot.io.lastMask = 0
    thought(bot, "interstitial: " & bot.percep.interstitialText)
    return 0

  # 2. First-pass sprite scans against the PREVIOUS frame's camera. These
  #    populate the visible* lists that ignoreFramePixel needs to score
  #    map candidates without dynamic-pixel poisoning.
  let scanCamera =
    if bot.percep.prev.valid: (bot.percep.prev.cameraX, bot.percep.prev.cameraY)
    else:                     (bot.percep.cameraX,      bot.percep.cameraY)
  scanAll(bot.percep, bot.sprites, scanCamera)  # crewmates, bodies, ghosts, task icons, role icon
  scanRadarDots(bot.percep)

  # 3. Localize using those matches as the ignore mask.
  let preLockCamera = (bot.percep.cameraX, bot.percep.cameraY)
  updateLocation(bot)             # may set localized, update camera
  let postLockCamera = (bot.percep.cameraX, bot.percep.cameraY)

  # 4. If camera jumped far (teleport, full spiral re-lock), the prev-camera
  #    scans are wrong. Re-scan against the new camera before tasks read them.
  if bot.percep.localized and
      not bot.percep.prev.valid or
      abs(postLockCamera[0] - preLockCamera[0]) > TeleportThresholdPx or
      abs(postLockCamera[1] - preLockCamera[1]) > TeleportThresholdPx:
    scanAll(bot.percep, bot.sprites, postLockCamera)
    scanRadarDots(bot.percep)

  updateMotion(bot.motion, bot.percep, bot.sim)
  rememberVisibleMap(bot.percep, bot.io)
  updateTaskGuesses(bot.tasks, bot.percep, bot.sim)
  updateTaskIcons(bot.tasks, bot.percep, bot.sim)
  clearGoal(bot.goal)

  if not bot.percep.localized:
    thought(bot, "waiting for lock")
    snapshotPrevFrame(bot.percep)
    return 0

  updateEvidence(bot.evidence, bot.percep, bot.identity, bot.frameTick)
  rememberHome(bot.percep)

  let mask =
    if bot.role == RoleImposter and not bot.isGhost:
      decideImposterMask(bot)
    else:
      decideCrewmateMask(bot)

  # 5. Snapshot end-of-pipeline state for next frame.
  snapshotPrevFrame(bot.percep)
  return mask
```

The inversion vs. v2 is the key change: in v2 sprite scans live *inside*
`updateLocation`, which is what creates the forward-decl smell. Here they
sit in their own module, run twice in the worst case (teleport), and once
in the common case (cameras drift smoothly).

The `TeleportThresholdPx` knob lives in `tuning.nim` and should be set
during the parity bake — too tight wastes scans every frame, too loose
lets stale matches poison post-vote frames.

## 6. Build, FFI, and entry points

### CLI binary

`modulabot.nim` is the entry point. Mirrors `evidencebot_v2.nim`'s
`isMainModule` block exactly: parse `--address --port --gui --name --map`,
delegate to `viewer/runner.runBot`. Compiles with:

```sh
nim c -d:release -o:mod_talks players/mod_talks/modulabot.nim
```

### Shared library

```sh
nim c --app:lib -d:modulabotLibrary \
  -o:players/mod_talks/libmodulabot.so \
  players/mod_talks/modulabot.nim
```

`build_modulabot.py` is a near-verbatim copy of `build_nottoodumb.py` with
two strings changed (path + define). Will live next to the existing build
helper; no shared-state collisions.

### FFI exports

In `ffi/lib.nim`:

```nim
proc modulabot_new_policy*(numAgents: cint): cint {.exportc, dynlib.}
proc modulabot_step_batch*(...) {.exportc, dynlib.}
```

Same calling convention, same `TrainableMasks` table, same handle-registry
pattern as nottoodumb/evidencebot. The FFI prefix stayed `modulabot_*` —
see §1.5 for why the planned rename was cancelled in Sprint 4.6.

The Python harness uses a new policy entry pointing at the existing symbols;
the wrapper at `cogames/amongthem_policy.py` is the source of truth for that
binding.

---

## 7. Parity test plan

Before any divergence from v2 strategy, prove parity:

1. **Compile both binaries** (`evidencebot_v2`, `modulabot`) from the same
   commit.
2. **Run head-to-head** with `tools/quick_run --connect --bots` and a fixed
   RNG seed (need to thread `--seed` through; v2 currently seeds from
   `getTime() ^ pid`).
3. **Compare per-frame output masks** for N frames given identical input
   frame streams. Easiest harness: a tiny Nim program that loads a captured
   `.replay` file and runs both bots' `stepUnpackedFrame*` against it,
   diffing the returned masks.
4. **Acceptance:** ≥99% mask agreement over a 10-game replay set; remaining
   <1% accounted for by RNG paths (random innocent picking, fake-task die
   rolls).

This bar sets the version line: anything that changes mask output is a
behavior change and goes in a separate PR after v0 is merged.

---

## 8. Migration / iteration plan

### Phase 0 — scaffold (this report's outcome)

- Create `players/modulabot/` and the `src/` skeleton with empty modules.
- Define `types.nim` and `tuning.nim` from v2's const block and type block.
- Wire up an empty `bot.nim` that compiles but does nothing.

### Phase 1 — perception layer

Port in dependency order: `geometry → frame → sprite_match → ascii →
localize → actors → tasks → motion → path → evidence`. After each module,
write a smoke test (load one captured frame, run the function, eyeball the
output).

### Phase 2 — policies & I/O

Port `chat → voting → policy_crew → policy_imp`, then `viewer/` and
`ffi/lib.nim`. At end of phase 2, modulabot should connect to a server and
play a round.

### Phase 3 — parity bake

Run the parity harness from §7. Fix any drift. Tag v0.

### Phase 4 — divergence (post-merge)

Open the door for actual improvements. Candidates I'd want to discuss:
better evidence model (quantitative suspicion instead of binary tiers),
imposter chat that's not just `body in X sus <random>`, ghost behavior
beyond "fly to tasks", proper `--seed` plumbing, vote bandwagon detection
on the crewmate side.

---

## 9. What I'm explicitly *not* changing in v0

For the record, so we don't argue about it later:

- The "30% black pixels = interstitial" heuristic.
- The patch-hash localization parameters (`PatchSize`, `PatchMinVotes`, etc).
- The eight-tier `nearestTaskGoal` fallback.
- The kill-button-icon-as-imposter-detector.
- The 100-tick `VoteListenTicks` delay before pressing A.
- The hard-coded `PlayerColorNames`.

Things that *are* changing in v0 (not strategy, but infrastructure):

- **`setCurrentDir(gameDir())` is gone** (Q8 resolved). `initBot` takes
  explicit `gameRoot`/`atlasPath`/`mapPath`, threaded through the CLI and
  FFI entry points, stored in `Bot.paths`. `gameDir()` becomes a single
  helper used only by `modulabot.nim` to compute defaults from
  `currentSourcePath()`. No process-wide side effects.
- **Sprite scans run before localization** (Q2 option c). See §5 for the
  pipeline. Not a strategy change; it's a perception-layer reordering with
  identical observable behavior in the common case.
- **RNG splits into per-consumer streams** (Q6). Determinism property: a
  change to the imposter-task die rolls cannot shift vote-tiebreak or
  random-innocent sequences. Each stream is seeded deterministically from a
  master seed in `initBot`.

## 10. Decisions log (formerly open questions)

All resolved on first review pass. Numbered for traceability.

| # | Topic | Resolution | Where it lives in this doc |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | `Goal` shared vs. split between crewmate/imposter | **Shared** — single `Goal` sub-record, matches v2 | §3 `Goal` block |
| Q2 | Sprite scan vs. localize ordering | **Option (c)** — explicit `PrevFrame` snapshot, scans run first against prev camera, re-scan after lock if camera jump exceeds `TeleportThresholdPx` | §3 `PrevFrame` block, §5 pipeline |
| Q3 | `bot.nim` importing every policy module | **Acceptable** — pipeline is `Bot`'s behavior, no separate `pipeline.nim` | §4 module DAG |
| Q4 | `var Bot` vs. explicit sub-record signatures | **Hybrid** — leaf procs take explicit sub-records; orchestrators take `var Bot` | §3 conventions |
| Q5 | Diagnostics access pattern | **`var Bot` carve-out** — any proc that calls `thought`/perf timers takes `var Bot` even if otherwise leaf | §3 conventions |
| Q6 | RNG substreams per consumer | **Per-consumer streams** in `RngStreams` sub-record, seeded deterministically from a master seed | §3 `RngStreams` block, §9 |
| Q7 | Parity harness location | **`players/modulabot/test/parity.nim`** to start; promote to `tools/bot_parity` only if a second bot pair wants the same harness | §7 |
| Q8 | `setCurrentDir` side effect | **Drop now** — explicit `Paths` sub-record threaded through `initBot` and `modulabot_new_policy` | §3 `Paths` block, §9 |
| Q9 | `tuning.nim` scope | **Knobs only** — `tuning.nim` holds the constants you'd actually A/B test (radii, thresholds, durations); module-internal magic numbers stay local | §4 `tuning.nim` summary |
| Q10 | Sprite atlas dedup across bots | **Defer** — one `Sprites` per `Bot` for v0, revisit after parity if memory is an issue in batched training | §3 `Sprites` block |
| Q11 | Viewer subdirectory | **Accepted** — `players/modulabot/viewer/` and `players/modulabot/ffi/` keep the gating boundary visible at directory level | §2 layout |
| Q12 | Strategy doc placement | **Link and leave** — modulabot's README links to `players/evidencebot_strategy.md`; copy if/when modulabot's strategy diverges | n/a |

## 11. Status log

### Fork from modulabot ✅

mod_talks was created by copying `players/modulabot/` at a point where
Phases 0–2 and Phase 5 (tracing) were all complete and Phase 3 (divergence)
was open. All status below describes inherited state from the fork point.
Phase 4 (LLM voting integration) is new work specific to mod_talks and is
described separately at the end of this section.

### Phase 0 — scaffold ✅

Directory tree, `types.nim` (sub-records + Bot envelope), `tuning.nim`,
inert `bot.nim` (`initBot` returning sentinel Bot, `decideNextMask`
returning 0), `modulabot.nim` CLI shim, `ffi/lib.nim` skeleton, and
`build_modulabot.py`. CLI binary (~600 KB) and shared library
(`libmodulabot.dylib` exporting `modulabot_new_policy` /
`modulabot_step_batch`) both build clean with zero warnings.

### Phase 1 — perception layer + policies ✅

All 16 strategy modules ported from v2. Two surprises during port:

- **Caught one near-parity-mistake:** `matchesCrewmate` — substituted
  hardcoded thresholds for v2's `Crewmate*Pixels` / `CrewmateMaxMisses`
  constants and dropped an early-out. Caught and fixed before any
  compile.
- **v2 had grown +93 lines since the structural map** — central-room
  stuck mitigation (`imposterCentralRoomTicks`, `forceLeaveUntilTick`,
  `inCentralRoom`, `centralRoomCenter`, `ImposterCentralRoom*`
  constants). Ported as part of `policy_imp` / `geometry`.

One small drift from the design: goal-selection helpers
(`taskGoalFor`, `buttonGoal`, `homeGoal`, `navigateToPoint`,
`inReportRange`, `inKillRange`, `reportBodyAction`) ended up in
`tasks.nim` because both policies need them. `tasks.nim` is the
largest module at 616 lines.

### Phase 2 — viewer + parity harness 🟡 (partial)

**Done:**
- Integration smoke test: modulabot + evidencebot_v2 + server, 45 s
  of real gameplay, both bots alive, no crashes, no error output.
- Frame capture: `modulabot --frames:<path>` writes raw unpacked
  frames (16384 bytes each) to disk while playing.
- Self-consistency parity harness at `players/modulabot/test/parity.nim`.
  Two modulabot instances with the same master seed run through the
  same frame stream and diff their masks every tick. Modes:
  `--mode:black` (interstitial path), `--mode:random`,
  `--mode:mixed`, `--replay:<file>` (real captured frames).
  Validated 257/257 frames match on a real-game capture. Confirms
  modulabot is internally deterministic and Q6's per-consumer RNG
  substreams are wired correctly.

**v2-vs-modulabot byte-level parity ✅** (added after initial Phase 2
write-up.) v2 was patched with three additive `*` exports (`Bot`,
`initBot`, `decideNextMask`) — no behavior change, both v2 builds
verified clean post-patch. The harness gained a `--vs:v2` mode and a
`runVsV2` proc that runs both bots through the same frame stream and
diffs masks.

**Results on a 4.5-minute (6,281-frame) full-game capture:**

- **Self-consistency: 6281/6281 (100%)** across multiple seeds —
  modulabot is fully deterministic; Q6 RNG-substream split is wired
  correctly with no hidden globals or clock-dependent paths.
- **vs v2: 5464/6281 (87.0%)**, with divergence beginning
  *contiguously* at frame ~2508 and never recovering. The first
  ~2500 frames matched byte-for-byte (covers all crewmate gameplay
  and perception/voting/interstitial paths).

The divergence pattern matches the predicted RNG drift exactly: v2
seeds from clock+pid and modulabot from `--seed`, so once an
imposter RNG path fires (fake-task die, random-innocent pick,
followee swap), both bots make different choices, end up in
different game states, and the per-tick mask stream stays divergent
for the rest of the game.

**Decision: parity validation declared sufficient.** The
2508-frame deterministic prefix demonstrates that no logic bugs were
introduced in the port; the full-game divergence pattern is
mathematically forced and uninformative. Pursuing 100% parity
beyond the first RNG decision would require modifying v2's RNG-init
path to accept a seed, which is more invasive than the additive
exports we already made and offers low marginal value over the
prefix-match evidence.

Both 30-second-capture (659/659) and full-game (5464/6281, 100% on
first 2508) results are recorded for posterity. Future regression
detection can use the harness's `--vs:self` mode against any
captured replay — that path stays at 100% as long as Q6 substreams
are intact.

**`viewer/viewer.nim` ✅** (added in a follow-up patch.) Full port of
v2:4229-4707 — drawing primitives, frame view, map view, status
panel, init/pump/open lifecycle. Three-panel layout (live frame top
left at 4× scale, map top right at 1.25×, ~30 lines of status text
below). `--gui` flag now opens the diagnostic window; closing the
window or pressing Esc terminates the bot cleanly. No silky/whisky/
windy code runs in library builds — the whole `viewer/` subdirectory
is gated by `when not defined(modulabotLibrary)`.

Behavior preserved verbatim modulo sub-record renames; final parity
check 659/659 still holds after viewer port.

### Phase 3 — divergence (partially shipped through Sprint 2-3 alibi work)

Originally framed as "open per the original plan." Sprint 2 work
moved several Phase-3 items forward:
  - **Long-term memory (v1)** shipped — see §13. Event log
    (sightings, bodies, meetings, alibis) plus per-colour summaries.
    `identity.lastSeen` retired in favour of
    `memory.summaries[i].lastSeenTick`. Trace schema bumped to v2.
  - **Alibi log wiring** shipped in Sprint 2.3 — `tasks.nim`
    `updateAlibiObservations` calls `memory.appendAlibi` on
    crewmate × task-icon co-visibility within
    `MemoryAlibiMatchRadius`. The "awaiting a caller" placeholder
    in this section is now satisfied.
  - **Self-position keyframes** shipped in Sprint 2.2 —
    `Memory.selfKeyframes` records every room transition;
    `myLocationHistoryJson` feeds the imposter LLM context.

Self-consistency parity 500/500 across seeds 1 / 42 / 100 / 7777
preserved through every Phase-3 increment.

Remaining Phase-3 directions, none of which have been started:

1. Better evidence model — quantitative suspicion scores instead of
   binary tiers (witnessed-kill vs near-body). Likely subsumed by
   Phase-4 LLM reasoning; may not be worth doing as a separate
   rule-based scoring pass.
2. Smarter imposter chat — partly addressed by Phase 4's
   `imposter_react` LLM path. Pre-meeting "fake-task callout"
   chat (during gameplay, not voting) remains rule-based.
3. Real ghost behavior — currently ghosts just keep doing tasks;
   could vent-watch, escort suspects, etc. Independent of LLM work.
4. Vote bandwagon detection on the crewmate side — partly addressed
   by Phase 4's `react` belief-update calls; the rule-based
   counterpart could log the pattern in trace events. Not started.
5. Patch v2 to accept `--seed` — would let parity testing exercise
   imposter paths properly. Tracked in `TODO.md`. Useful only if a
   non-LLM strategy change ever lands.

### Phase 5 — tracing for outer-loop self-improvement ✅

Structured trace generation shipped in four sub-phases (see
`TRACING.md` for the full design + status table). Goal: feed an
outer-loop LLM harness that proposes edits to `policy_*.nim` based
on the bot's own experience.

**What landed:**

- New `trace.nim` module — manifest + events + decisions +
  snapshots, JSON serialisation, diff-state for edge detection.
- New `tuning_snapshot.nim` — single-source-of-truth dump of every
  policy const into the manifest, so harness lineage tracking can
  correlate outcomes with compiled-in tunables.
- 29 stable branch IDs across `policy_crew.nim`, `policy_imp.nim`,
  `voting.nim`, and `bot.nim`'s early-return paths. Catalogued in
  `BRANCH_IDS.md` (auto-generated by `tools/gen_branch_ids.nim`).
- Per-line voting-screen chat capture via a new `visibleChatLines`
  iterator in `voting.nim`; `chat_observed` events stream into
  `events.jsonl`. Speaker attribution deferred to v2 (see TRACING.md
  §15) — `speaker: null` for now.
- New `Bot.trace` field, `bot.fired(branchId, intent)` helper,
  `decideNextMaskCore` / `decideNextMask` split (the public proc is
  now a thin wrapper that calls `traceFrame` after the policy runs).
- CLI flags: `--trace-dir`, `--trace-level`, `--trace-snapshot-period`,
  `--trace-meta`, `--trace-frames-dump` / `--no-trace-frames-dump`.
  Equivalent env vars: `MODULABOT_TRACE_DIR` etc.
- FFI: `modulabot_init_trace` exported proc; per-agent trace
  attachment in `modulabot_new_policy` and on dynamic resize in
  `modulabot_step_batch`.
- Smoke pipeline at `tools/trace_smoke.sh` runs parity (no trace) +
  parity (with trace) + end-to-end smoke + branch-IDs drift detection.

**Determinism:** the trace writer reads `Bot` after `decideNextMask`
returns and never mutates it (modulo its own internal shadow). The
parity test verifies this end-to-end:

- self-consistency, no trace: 500/500 black-mode + 50/50 mixed-mode
  @ multiple seeds — 100% match.
- self-consistency, with trace on bot A: 500/500 black-mode — trace
  is non-perturbing.

**Replay support:** every manifest carries `master_seed` and (when
auto-frames-dump is on, default) the path to the captured frame
stream. Reproducing a game's mask sequence is `nim r test/parity.nim
--replay:<frames> --seed:<seed>` away. The harness can re-emit
exhaustive traces with `--trace-level:full` for offline
investigation.

**Open work (intentionally deferred):**

- Speaker attribution for `chat_observed` events. Requires sampling
  the per-line speaker pip pixels left of `VoteChatTextX = 21`.
  Trace schema already carries the `speaker: null` field and a
  `manifest.trace_settings.speaker_attribution` enum so v1 traces
  remain readable when v2 ships.
- Frames-dump rotation / retention. v1 keeps everything; long runs
  will fill disk. The harness can post-process / delete as needed.
- Counterfactual annotations (which tier of `nearestTaskGoal` won)
  — the goal struct already carries enough state to reconstruct
  this offline; surfacing it in the trace is a v1.1 task if needed.

See `TRACING.md` for full schemas, hook points, the open-questions
log, and the implementation status table.

### Phase 4 — LLM voting integration (Sprint 1-5 shipped)

This is the primary new direction for mod_talks. High-level design in
§14; detailed design in `LLM_VOTING.md`; sprint-by-sprint
implementation status in `LLM_SPRINTS.md` (the source of truth).

**Sprint-by-sprint summary:**

- **Sprint 1 — Observability.** Trace schema v3:
  `llm_dispatched` / `llm_decision` / `llm_error` /
  `llm_layer_active` events; `trace_settings.llm_compiled_in` /
  `.llm_layer_active` flags; session counters under
  `summary_counters.llm`. `MODULABOT_TRACE_DIR` works in the FFI
  path (was CLI-only).
- **Sprint 2 — Inputs the LLM was starving on.** Speaker pip
  detection (`voting.detectChatSpeaker`) flips
  `trace_settings.speaker_attribution: "color_pip"`. Self-position
  keyframes (`Memory.selfKeyframes`) feed `my_location_history`
  for imposter contexts. Alibi log wired
  (`tasks.updateAlibiObservations`). Ejection detection
  (`voting.detectResultEjection`) populates
  `MeetingEvent.ejected`. Latent unreachable-meeting-finalize bug
  caught and fixed (`bot.finalizeMeeting`).
- **Sprint 3 — Regression-safe `llm.nim`.** Mock-LLM harness
  (`llmMockLoadFromFile` / `llmMockEnable` / `llmMockPump`) runs
  scripted JSONL fixtures without HTTP. `--mode:llm-mock` in
  `parity.nim`. 56-test suite in `test/llm_unit.nim`. Context
  builders refactored to return `JsonNode` so a 7-tier
  `trimContextInPlace` policy guards the FFI buffer.
- **Sprint 4 — Concurrency, tool-use, retries, transliteration.**
  `ThreadPoolExecutor` in `AmongThemPolicy` with dispatch / gather
  phases (3-4× speedup verified live). Per-call-kind timeouts.
  Stale-response detection in `onLlmResponse`. Anthropic tool-use
  with one tool per `LlmCallKind`. Retry/backoff for retryable
  exceptions. UTF-8 → ASCII transliteration in `clampChat`.
- **Sprint 5 — Quality iteration infrastructure.** Prompt-eval
  harness at `tools/llm_prompt_eval.py` plus optional context
  capture (`MODTALKS_LLM_CAPTURE=1` writes
  `<round>/llm_contexts/`). `LlmPersuadeEnabled` runtime-toggle
  (`MODTALKS_PERSUADE`). `_OpenAIController` skeleton with
  `_build_llm_controller` selector. Manifest lineage:
  `harness_meta.{llm_provider, llm_model, llm_persuade,
  llm_disabled}`. All 14 public `tuning.nim` constants reflected
  in `tuning_snapshot.nim`; `trace_smoke.sh` step 7 warns on
  drift.

**Sprint 4.6 — FFI prefix rename — explicitly cancelled.** See
§1.5 for rationale.

**Deferred follow-ups** (need access / budget, not code):

- 40+ game persuasion A/B campaign (Sprint 5.2).
- Live OpenAI verification (Sprint 5.3 — needs `OPENAI_API_KEY`).

**Known minor limitations** (logged, not on the critical path):

- Manifest staleness on truncated runs — manifest is rewritten at
  `endRound`. FFI-path runs that exit mid-round show stale
  `trace_settings.llm_layer_active: false` and zero
  `summary_counters.llm`. Emitted events are correct.
- `validate_trace` rejects rounds with unclosed meetings — fires
  on `--max-steps` truncation. Consider a `--allow-truncated`
  flag.
- Reporter detection (who pressed the meeting button) deferred
  separate from ejected detection.

## 12. Running mod_talks

### Build

The bot lives in `players/mod_talks/`. The CLI binary and the FFI
shared library are separate compile targets. Both are built relative
to the repo root because of the project-wide `config.nims` (which
adds `common/` and the nimby-managed package paths).

```sh
cd /Users/me/p/bitworld

# CLI binary (release mode is the default via config.nims).
nim c -o:among_them/players/mod_talks/mod_talks \
  among_them/players/mod_talks/modulabot.nim

# CLI binary with the LLM layer enabled (requires modTalksLlm define).
nim c -d:modTalksLlm \
  -o:among_them/players/mod_talks/mod_talks_llm \
  among_them/players/mod_talks/modulabot.nim

# Shared library (FFI for the cogames runner / training harness).
# The Python helper handles nimby + Nim version + adds -d:modTalksLlm
# automatically when MODULABOT_LLM=1 is set.
MODULABOT_LLM=1 python3 \
  among_them/players/mod_talks/build_modulabot.py
```

Without `-d:modTalksLlm`, every LLM call site is dead-coded out and
the bot is bit-for-bit identical to modulabot. The parity harness
(`test/parity.nim`) verifies this on every commit.

### CLI flags

| Flag | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `--address:HOST` | `localhost` | Server host |
| `--port:N` | `8080` | Server port |
| `--name:STR` | `""` | Player name (sent in WS query) |
| `--gui` | off | Open the diagnostic viewer (Esc to quit) |
| `--frames:PATH` | off | Dump every received unpacked frame to `PATH` (16384 bytes per frame) for offline replay |
| `--map:PATH` | (sim default) | Override the map JSON path |
| `--trace-dir:PATH` | off | Enable structured tracing under `PATH` (see TRACING.md) |
| `--trace-level:LVL` | `decisions` | `events` / `decisions` / `full`. `events` skips per-decision logging; `full` emits per-frame |
| `--trace-snapshot-period:N` | `120` | Ticks between belief-state snapshots |
| `--trace-meta:K=V[,K=V]*` | empty | Free-form metadata into `manifest.harness_meta` for lineage tracking |
| `--trace-frames-dump` / `--no-trace-frames-dump` | on (when `--trace-dir` set) | Auto-dump frames to `<trace-dir>/<bot>/<session>/frames.bin` for replay |
| `--llm-mock:PATH` | empty | Sprint 3.1 — load scripted JSONL responses instead of dispatching real provider calls. Requires `-d:modTalksLlm`; ignored otherwise |

### Environment variables

CLI flags above each have a `MODULABOT_*` env-var equivalent
(explicit flags win). The full set:

| Env var | Equivalent flag | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `MODULABOT_TRACE_DIR` | `--trace-dir` | Trace output root |
| `MODULABOT_TRACE_LEVEL` | `--trace-level` | Trace verbosity |
| `MODULABOT_TRACE_SNAPSHOT_PERIOD` | `--trace-snapshot-period` | Snapshot cadence |
| `MODULABOT_TRACE_META` | `--trace-meta` | Manifest harness_meta |
| `MODULABOT_TRACE_FRAMES_DUMP` | `--[no-]trace-frames-dump` | Auto-frame-capture |
| `MODTALKS_LLM_MOCK` | `--llm-mock` | Mock JSONL fixture path |

LLM-only env vars (consumed by `cogames/amongthem_policy.py`):

| Env var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Direct Anthropic API key (alternative to Bedrock) |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` / `AWS_REGION` / `AWS_PROFILE` | Bedrock credentials (preferred) |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1` | Force Bedrock even with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI fallback (Sprint 5.3, structural — not yet live-tested) |
| `MODTALKS_PROVIDER_OPENAI=1` | Force OpenAI provider even if Anthropic creds are present |
| `MODTALKS_LLM_MODEL` | Override default model id |
| `MODTALKS_LLM_DISABLE=1` | Hard-disable the LLM layer (bot runs as rule-based modulabot) |
| `MODTALKS_LLM_DEADLINE_SECONDS` | Sprint 4.1 — wall-clock cap for `step_batch` to gather in-flight futures (default 12.0) |
| `MODTALKS_PERSUADE=1` | Sprint 5.2 — runtime override for `LlmPersuadeEnabled` |
| `MODTALKS_LLM_CAPTURE=1` | Sprint 5.1 — write dispatched contexts under `<round>/llm_contexts/` for prompt-eval replay |

Note: modulabot defaults to `:8080`, but most local Among-Them
servers bind to `:2000` or `:8080` depending on how they were
started. Always pass `--port:N` matching the server.

### Single instance

Connect one mod_talks bot to a server already running on `:2000`:

```sh
among_them/players/mod_talks/mod_talks \
  --address:localhost --port:2000 --name:mt1
```

With the diagnostic viewer:

```sh
among_them/players/mod_talks/mod_talks \
  --address:localhost --port:2000 --name:mt1 --gui
```

With frame capture for later parity / debug replay:

```sh
among_them/players/mod_talks/mod_talks \
  --address:localhost --port:2000 --name:mt1 \
  --frames:/tmp/run.bin
```

With structured tracing for the outer-loop harness:

```sh
among_them/players/mod_talks/mod_talks \
  --address:localhost --port:2000 --name:mt1 \
  --trace-dir:/tmp/runs \
  --trace-meta:experiment_id=baseline,git_sha=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

With the mock-LLM harness (deterministic; no real provider calls):

```sh
among_them/players/mod_talks/mod_talks_llm \
  --address:localhost --port:2000 --name:mt1 \
  --llm-mock:among_them/players/mod_talks/test/fixtures/llm_mock_basic.jsonl
```

### Live LLM games (cogames runner)

The end-to-end Bedrock launcher lives at
`scripts/launch_mod_talks_llm_local.py` and uses metta's
`bitworld_runner.run_bitworld_episode` (so the run shape matches
the cogames tournament worker exactly). Prereqs: built server,
built dylib (`MODULABOT_LLM=1 python3 build_modulabot.py`),
metta venv, AWS SSO logged in.

```sh
AWS_PROFILE=softmax AWS_REGION=us-east-1 CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1 \
  MODULABOT_TRACE_DIR=/tmp/run \
  ~/coding/metta/.venv/bin/python \
  among_them/players/mod_talks/scripts/launch_mod_talks_llm_local.py \
  --port 8081 --no-browser --max-steps 5000
```

Add `MODTALKS_LLM_CAPTURE=1` to dump dispatched contexts under
`<trace>/<bot>/<session>/round-NNNN/llm_contexts/` for the prompt-eval
harness:

```sh
MODTALKS_LLM_CAPTURE=1 ... launch_mod_talks_llm_local.py ...
```

This writes one round directory per game under
`/tmp/runs/mt1/<session-id>/round-NNNN/` containing `manifest.json`,
`events.jsonl`, `decisions.jsonl`, `snapshots.jsonl`, plus (by
default) a `frames.bin` capture in the parent session directory.
See `TRACING.md` for the schema and `BRANCH_IDS.md` for the
canonical branch-ID list.

Validate emitted traces:

```sh
nim r among_them/players/mod_talks/test/validate_trace.nim \
  --root:/tmp/runs
```

### Multiple instances via `tools/quick_run`

The repo's `tools/quick_run` helper can connect to an existing server,
compile a bot, and spawn N copies. It accepts either a bare label
(matched against the selected game's `players` folder) or a
repository-relative path. mod_talks lives one level deeper than the
older bots, so the **path form is required**:

```sh
cd /Users/me/p/bitworld
nim r tools/quick_run among_them --connect \
  --bots:among_them/players/mod_talks/modulabot.nim:8 \
  --bot-name-prefix:mt \
  --address:localhost --port:2000
```

Spawns 8 mod_talks bots named `mt1` … `mt8`. Override the
naming with `--bot-name-prefix:foo` to get `foo1` … `foo8`.

`quick_run` bot build mode is `nim c <file>` from the repo root,
which inherits the project's `config.nims` and produces a release
build by default. No special flag needed.

### Mixed lobbies

The cleanest pattern is to fill the lobby with `quick_run` and
add a single GUI'd instance separately:

```sh
# Terminal A: 7 headless mod_talks bots
nim r tools/quick_run among_them --connect \
  --bots:among_them/players/mod_talks/modulabot.nim:7 \
  --bot-name-prefix:mt \
  --address:localhost --port:2000

# Terminal B: 1 mod_talks bot with the diagnostic viewer
among_them/players/mod_talks/mod_talks \
  --address:localhost --port:2000 --name:mtgui --gui
```

Or mix bot families to test against modulabot / nottoodumb:

```sh
# Terminal A: 4 modulabots
nim r tools/quick_run among_them --connect \
  --bots:among_them/players/modulabot/modulabot.nim:4 \
  --bot-name-prefix:mb \
  --address:localhost --port:2000

# Terminal B: 3 mod_talks bots
nim r tools/quick_run among_them --connect \
  --bots:among_them/players/mod_talks/modulabot.nim:3 \
  --bot-name-prefix:mt \
  --address:localhost --port:2000

# Terminal C: 1 GUI'd mod_talks bot
among_them/players/mod_talks/mod_talks \
  --address:localhost --port:2000 --name:mtgui --gui
```

### Two `quick_run` caveats

1. **`--gui` propagates to all spawned processes.** Passing
   `--bot-gui` to `quick_run` opens a viewer window for every
   modulabot. For >1 instance you almost certainly want some
   headless via `quick_run` and at most one GUI'd via the
   standalone binary.

2. **quick_run kills managed children when any one exits.** If a
   game ends and one modulabot disconnects, every other modulabot
   in that quick_run group is terminated. The standalone
   `runBot` reconnect loop keeps retrying forever and is more
   resilient for long-running setups.

### Parity / regression tests

The harness at `players/mod_talks/test/parity.nim` runs in two
modes:

```sh
# Build (release mode for speed)
nim c -d:release -o:among_them/players/mod_talks/test/parity \
  among_them/players/mod_talks/test/parity.nim

# Self-consistency: two mod_talks instances, same seed, same frames.
# Always 100% if Q6 RNG-substream determinism is intact.
among_them/players/mod_talks/test/parity \
  --replay:/tmp/run.bin --vs:self

# vs evidencebot_v2: byte-equivalent on non-RNG paths. Diverges
# contiguously at the first imposter RNG decision (v2 has no seed
# override) — see §11 phase-2 status for context.
among_them/players/mod_talks/test/parity \
  --replay:/tmp/run.bin --vs:v2
```

Other harness modes for synthetic frames: `--mode:black` (interstitial
path, fast), `--mode:random` (slow — exhaustive spiral search per
frame), `--mode:mixed` (alternates).

`--trace-dir:PATH` attaches a trace writer to bot A during the
self-consistency run. Used to verify the trace writer is
non-perturbing (see `TRACING.md` §13.2 / Phase 5 status).

For the full local CI loop (build + parity + smoke + branch-ID
drift), use the wrapper script:

```sh
among_them/players/mod_talks/tools/trace_smoke.sh
```

### Capturing a replay

To capture a real-game frame stream for later parity / debugging:

```sh
among_them/players/mod_talks/mod_talks \
  --address:localhost --port:2000 --name:capture \
  --frames:/tmp/run.bin
```

The file grows at ~24 fps × 16384 bytes/frame ≈ 24 MB per minute of
gameplay. Format is a flat concatenation of unpacked frames; record
count is `filesize / 16384`. The mask is *not* recorded — the parity
harness re-derives it by running each bot on the captured frame,
which is the right semantic for offline parity testing.

---

## 13. Long-term memory (v1) — shipped

v0 evidence was a single scalar per colour (most-recent `nearBodyTicks`
and `witnessedKillTicks`). That collapsed time and co-witness structure
and made it hard for the voting/planning policies — or the outer-loop
LLM harness — to reason about patterns across a round. v1 adds an
event log plus incrementally-maintained per-player summaries,
preserving the scalar cache for parity with v0 voting logic.

Implementation landed in `memory.nim`, `types.nim`, `evidence.nim`,
`actors.nim`, `bot.nim`, and `trace.nim`. Parity validated:
self-consistency remains 500/500 across seeds 1 / 42 / 100 / 7777 in
black mode and 50/50 in mixed mode; trace remains non-perturbing
(500/500 with `--trace-dir` attached to bot A).

### 13.1. Event categories

Four categories, all round-scoped. Raw sightings and alibis are
trimmed at meeting boundaries; bodies and meetings persist for the
whole round.

| Category | Trigger | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|
| Sighting | Non-self, non-teammate colour visible this frame (dedup'd by tick Δ + pixel Δ) | Trimmed at meeting close; summary persists |
| Body | Body newly appears (v2 "witnessedKill" signal), or first-seen body persists | Retained for the round |
| Meeting | Voting screen closes | Retained for the round |
| Alibi | Colour seen at a task terminal, or a task-completion flash co-occurs with a recently-seen colour | Trimmed at meeting close; summary persists |

### 13.2. Types

Added to `types.nim` alongside `Evidence`:

```nim
type
  SightingEvent* = object
    tick*: int
    colorIndex*: int
    x*, y*: int
    roomId*: int                  # -1 if outside any named room

  BodyWitness* = object
    colorIndex*: int
    dx*, dy*: int                 # offset from body at witness tick

  BodyEvent* = object
    tick*: int
    x*, y*: int
    roomId*: int
    witnesses*: seq[BodyWitness]
    isNewBody*: bool              # v2's "witnessedKill" signal

  MeetingEvent* = object
    startTick*: int
    endTick*: int
    reporter*: int                # -1 if unknown — reporter detection
                                  # deferred (separate perception work)
    selfVote*: int                # VoteSkip / color / VoteUnknown
    votes*: PerColor[int]
    ejected*: int                 # -1 unknown / -2 skipped / else color
                                  # (Sprint 2.4 populates from
                                  # voting.detectResultEjection)
    chatLines*: seq[VoteChatLine] # OCR + speaker attribution
                                  # (Sprint 2.1 — was seq[string])

  AlibiEvent* = object
    tick*: int
    colorIndex*: int
    taskIndex*: int

  PlayerSummary* = object
    lastSeenTick*: int
    lastSeenX*, lastSeenY*: int
    lastSeenRoomId*: int
    timesNearBody*: int
    timesWitnessedKill*: int
    timesVotedForMe*: int
    timesIVotedForThem*: int
    timesVotedWithMe*: int
    taskBits*: uint64             # which task indices we've seen them at
    distinctTasksObserved*: int   # popcount(taskBits), cached
    ejected*: bool

  Memory* = object
    sightings*: seq[SightingEvent]
    bodies*: seq[BodyEvent]
    meetings*: seq[MeetingEvent]
    alibis*: seq[AlibiEvent]
    summaries*: PerColor[PlayerSummary]
    lastMeetingEndTick*: int      # sighting/alibi trim boundary

# Bot gains:
#   memory*: Memory
```

Lives in a new `memory.nim` module, imported by `evidence.nim`,
`voting.nim`, and both `policy_*` modules. `evidence.nim`'s existing
`updateEvidence` keeps its current signature but becomes a thin
consumer of `memory.recordBodyFrame(...)` — the scalar
`nearBodyTicks` / `witnessedKillTicks` remain as a hot-path cache
populated from memory appends so existing voting code (`evidence.nim`
`evidenceBasedSuspect`) keeps working unchanged.

### 13.3. Lifetime rules

- **Round reset:** clear all four logs and summaries at the role-reveal
  interstitial (or equivalent round-boundary signal). Mirrors how
  humans play; avoids cross-round leakage.
- **Trim at meeting close:** after the voting screen closes and the
  `MeetingEvent` is appended, discard `SightingEvent`s and
  `AlibiEvent`s with `tick < lastMeetingEndTick`. Their contribution
  has already updated the per-colour summary on write; the raw
  records exist only for the "since last meeting" reasoning window.
- **Body and meeting logs never trim:** at most ~10 of each per round.

### 13.4. Dedup and thresholds

Sightings are the hot-path category. Dedup rule: don't append a new
`SightingEvent` for colour `c` if the previous sighting for `c` was
within `MemorySightingDedupTicks` ticks AND within
`MemorySightingDedupPixels` pixels. Both constants live in
`tuning.nim`. Starting values `5 / 16` — bake during first integration
test. The per-colour summary (`lastSeenTick`, `lastSeenX/Y`) updates
on *every* visible frame regardless of dedup; the dedup only governs
raw event-log growth.

### 13.5. Migration of `identity.lastSeen`

`identity.lastSeen: PerColor[int]` is removed. Its callers (in
`evidence.nim`'s `suspectedColor` and `randomInnocentColor`, plus any
direct reads from `policy_*`) switch to
`bot.memory.summaries[i].lastSeenTick`. One-shot audit; parity
(self-consistency) must remain 100% — the timing of
`lastSeenTick` writes must match v2-era `identity.lastSeen` writes
exactly (same frames, same colours skipped).

### 13.6. `trace.nim` consolidation

Single-source-of-truth rule: the trace writer observes `Memory`
appends instead of maintaining parallel diff state.

Diff fields on `TraceWriter` (`types.nim`) that became redundant and
were removed:

| Field | Replacement |
|---|---|
| `prevBodyWorldPositions` | `prevBodiesCount` shadow over `memory.bodies` — new entries emit `body_seen_first` events from the BodyEvent payload (witnesses, roomId, isNewBody). |

Fields from the original plan that were **kept** (deviation from the
design):

| Field | Reason |
|---|---|
| `prevSelfVoteChoice` | Per-tick change detection for the `vote_cast` event during an active meeting. `MeetingEvent` is finalized at meeting close and can't drive edge-triggered events that fire *inside* a meeting. |
| `prevVoteChoices` | Same reason, for `vote_observed` events as each other player's vote lands. |

These two are not genuinely "redundant" — `MeetingEvent.votes` is an
aggregate final snapshot, whereas trace wants to emit one event per
vote transition as it happens. Reconciling that would require either
(a) live-updating `memory.meetings[^1]` on every observed vote change,
which duplicates `voting.choices` across two locations, or (b) moving
per-tick vote events out of trace. Neither is a win; the kept shadows
are the pragmatic choice.

Fields that stay (not memory-backed, never were in scope):

| Field | Reason |
|---|---|
| `prevStuckActive` / `prevStuckStartTick` | Motion state, not observation memory |
| `prevRole` / `prevIsGhost` / `prevSelfColor` | Bot scalars, not memory |
| `prevInterstitial` / `prevInterstitialText` / `prevGameOverText` | Perception, not memory |
| `prevLocalized` / `prevCameraLock` | Perception, not memory |
| `prevTaskStates` / `prevTaskResolved` | Task state, not observation memory |
| `prevKillReady` | Imposter state, not observation memory |

Trace schema bumped to v2 in v1 memory work; v3 in Sprint 1
(LLM observability). Both bumps are additive — `is_new_body` on
`body_seen_first` (v2), and the LLM event family
(`llm_dispatched` / `llm_decision` / `llm_error` /
`llm_layer_active`) plus manifest fields
`trace_settings.llm_compiled_in` / `.llm_layer_active` and
`summary_counters.llm` (v3). `validate_trace` and `trace_smoke`
accept schemas v1, v2, and v3.

### 13.7. Deferred / out of scope (v1)

- **Chat-based accusation attribution** — partly addressed.
  Speaker attribution shipped in Sprint 2.1 via
  `voting.detectChatSpeaker`; `MeetingEvent.chatLines` carries
  speaker-color indices. Higher-level "X accused Y at tick N"
  parsing remains future work.
- **Task-claim / location-claim parsing** — future work; would
  layer on top of the chat-line + speaker stream.
- **Disappearance events** (visible → gone → body appears at last-seen
  location) — computable from the sighting + body logs post-hoc; no
  need for a separate event category in v1.
- **Co-presence windows** — computable from the sighting log on
  demand; don't pre-aggregate.
- **Ring-buffer caps** — the meeting-boundary trim rule bounds the
  hot categories to ~O(ticks since last meeting). Cap introduction
  is a v1.1 concern if profile data shows it's needed.

### 13.8. Determinism / parity implications

- Self-consistency parity test must stay 100%. Two identically-seeded
  bots must produce identical `Memory` state → identical emitted
  trace events.
- Iteration order matters: `visibleCrewmates` ordering is already
  deterministic (scan order); appending in that order keeps the
  sighting log deterministic.
- The trace refactor changes the *code path* for emitting body/vote
  events but not their *content*. Existing `validate_trace` tooling
  should continue passing.

### 13.9. Implementation (shipped)

Landed in order:

1. Types + Memory scaffolding (`types.nim`, `memory.nim`,
   `tuning.nim` knobs).
2. `identity.lastSeen` migrated to `memory.summaries[i].lastSeenTick`
   in `evidence.nim` (`suspectedColor`, `randomInnocentColor`),
   `actors.nim` (`scanCrewmates` → `memory.appendSighting`),
   `bot.nim` (`resetRoundState`, `initBot`). Self-consistency parity
   remained 500/500.
3. `updateEvidence` in `evidence.nim` extended to call
   `memory.appendBody` alongside the scalar `witnessedKillTicks`
   cache on new-body detection. Parity preserved.
4. `trace.nim` refactored to consume `memory.bodies` for
   `body_seen_first` / `kill_witnessed` events via a `prevBodiesCount`
   shadow. `prevBodyWorldPositions` removed; schema bumped to v2.
   Validators updated. Parity preserved (with and without
   `--trace-dir` attached).
5. Meeting close in `decideNextMaskCore` now appends a
   `MeetingEvent` to memory before calling `clearVotingState`.
   `bot.memory.recordVoteForMe` / `recordIVotedForThem` translate
   slot→colour once per meeting so the summary counters are
   authoritative. `memory.trimAtMeetingEnd` drops sighting/alibi
   raw events older than the meeting end.

#### Implementation notes

- **Hook shape.** The originally-proposed `onAppend` callback on
  Memory was dropped in favour of a pull model: trace shadows
  `memory.bodies.len` and observes growth. This avoids a callback
  plumbing layer and keeps `memory.nim` as pure data + pure append
  procs with no dependency on trace. The "single source of truth"
  rule still holds — there's only one place that records a body
  (`memory.appendBody`) and one place that emits the event.
- **Alibi appends shipped (Sprint 2.3).** Wired from
  `tasks.nim:updateAlibiObservations` on co-visibility of a task
  icon + crewmate within `MemoryAlibiMatchRadius` world-pixels of
  the task centre. Self is filtered at the call site.
- **`reporter` deferred, `ejected` shipped (Sprint 2.4).**
  Ejected-color detection lives in
  `voting.nim:detectResultEjection` — reads the post-vote result
  frame for either the centered player sprite or the "NO ONE DIED"
  text. Stored in `VotingState.resultEjected` (preserved across
  `clearVotingState` for the meeting finalizer to consume).
  `MeetingEvent.ejected` schema is now three-state: `-1` unknown,
  `-2` skipped, else color index. Reporter detection (who pressed
  the meeting button) remains deferred — separate perception work,
  lower leverage than the ejection outcome.
- **Self-position keyframes (Sprint 2.2).** New
  `Memory.selfKeyframes: seq[SelfKeyframe]` recorded by
  `observeSelfRoom` on every named-room transition (corridors with
  `roomId == -1` skipped). Ring-buffer cap
  `MemorySelfKeyframeCap = 64`. Never trimmed at meeting boundary
  — imposter LLM context needs the full pre-meeting history.
- **Schema migrated to `seq[VoteChatLine]` (Sprint 2.1).**
  `MeetingEvent.chatLines` was `seq[string]` in the v1 schema;
  it's now `seq[VoteChatLine]` carrying per-line speaker
  attribution from `voting.detectChatSpeaker`.

## 14. LLM voting integration

This section describes the LLM layer at a high level. The full detailed
design — pipeline stages, state machine, type definitions, prompt
architecture, async call mechanism, timing analysis, and open questions —
is in `LLM_VOTING.md`. Sprint-by-sprint implementation status with
checkboxes is in `LLM_SPRINTS.md` (the source of truth for "what
shipped vs. what's outstanding").

**Status: shipped through Sprint 5.** The Nim state machine, FFI,
Anthropic Bedrock/direct + OpenAI Python wrappers, mock-LLM harness,
trace observability with optional context capture, concurrent dispatch,
per-call-kind timeouts + tool-use + retries + UTF-8 transliteration,
and the prompt-eval harness all exist and have been verified live.
Two follow-ups remain deferred (40+ game persuasion A/B; live OpenAI
verification) — both need access / budget rather than code. See §11
Phase 4 for the sprint-by-sprint summary and `LLM_SPRINTS.md` for
checkboxes.

### 14.1 Motivation

mod_talks inherits modulabot's rule-based voting: `evidenceBasedSuspect`
picks the player with the highest `nearBodyTicks` or `witnessedKillTicks`
score, and `decideVotingMask` drives the cursor to that slot after a
fixed `VoteListenTicks` delay. Chat during voting is templated: one of
a small set of hard-coded accusation strings.

Two weaknesses the LLM is intended to address:

1. **Inflexible reasoning.** The evidence model is binary (witnessed
   kill vs. near body) and ignores conversational context: what other
   players are saying, voting patterns, prior meeting history. An LLM
   with access to the full `Memory` log can weigh these signals.
2. **Bot-detectable chat.** The fixed-template messages are trivially
   distinguishable from human chat. An LLM can generate contextually
   appropriate, varied messages that react to what others are saying.

### 14.2 Scope of the LLM layer

The LLM replaces or augments exactly two functions:

- **Vote decision** (`voting.nim:decideVotingMask` / the
  `evidenceBasedSuspect` call in `evidence.nim`). Instead of (or in
  addition to) the evidence score, the LLM receives a structured
  context and returns a vote target (a player colour index or "skip").
- **Chat generation** (`chat.nim:queueBodyReport` / the imposter chat
  template in `policy_imp.nim`). During the voting phase, instead of a
  fixed template, the LLM receives a context and returns a chat message
  string, which is queued via the existing `ChatState.pendingChat`
  mechanism.

Everything outside the voting phase — navigation, task execution, kill
logic, evidence accumulation, perception — is unchanged.

### 14.3 Per-role pipeline summary

**Crewmate:**
1. On meeting start: dispatch an async LLM call with full `Memory` context
   to form a suspect hypothesis with likelihood scores.
2. If hypothesis confidence is high, generate and queue an accusation
   chat message.
3. As new chat lines appear from other players, dispatch rate-limited
   belief-update calls that update the hypothesis and optionally generate
   responses (challenge, question, or support for a claim).
4. Once confidence crosses `LlmVoteThreshold` or `VoteListenTicks` elapses,
   vote for the top suspect. Optionally send a persuasion message.

**Imposter:**
1. On meeting start: wait silently. Track accusation counts per player.
2. When a non-imposter player accumulates enough accusations from other
   players, identify them as the bandwagon target.
3. Generate a corroborating false-evidence message consistent with the
   bot's own location history and existing accusers' claims.
4. Vote for the bandwagon target. If no target emerged, skip.

### 14.4 Compile-time gating

All LLM call sites are gated by `when defined(modTalksLlm)`. Without
the flag, the binary is bit-for-bit equivalent to modulabot and the
parity harness must continue to pass at 100%. The flag is off by
default.

### 14.5 Integration points (summary, as shipped)

| Where | What changes |
|---|---|
| `types.nim` | Adds `LlmVotingState`, `LlmState`, `LlmMock`, `VoteChatLine`, `SelfKeyframe` to the `Bot` composition (+ `LlmCallKind`, `LlmVotingStage`, `LlmRequestSlot`, `LlmSuspect`, `LlmHypothesis`, `LlmImposterStrategy`, `LlmChatEntry`, `LlmSessionCounters`, `LlmMockEntry`) |
| `voting.nim` | `decideVotingMask` consults `llmVoting.voteTarget` when set; `tickLlmVoting(bot)` runs each frame inside `bot.nim`'s interstitial branch when voting is active. New `detectChatSpeaker` (Sprint 2.1) and `detectResultEjection` (Sprint 2.4) procs. |
| `chat.nim` | No change; LLM queues via existing `pendingChat` path |
| `llm.nim` (new) | Context assembly (returns `JsonNode` so `trimContextInPlace` can apply Sprint 3.4's 7-tier shrink policy), state-machine pipelines for both roles, response parsing/validation, mock harness (Sprint 3.1), session-counter maintenance, FFI surface |
| `bot.nim` | New `finalizeMeeting` proc owns `MeetingEvent` append (Sprint 2.4 fix). `decideNextMaskCore` calls `tickLlmVoting` after `parseVotingScreen`. `initBot` zero-inits `LlmState`. `resetRoundState` clears LLM voting state but preserves `enabled`. |
| `tuning.nim` | `LlmAccuseThreshold`, `LlmVoteThreshold`, `LlmChatReactionCooldownTicks`, `LlmMaxChatLen`, `LlmMaxContextLen`, `LlmMaxContextBytes`, `LlmPersuadeEnabled`, plus the Memory tunables `MemorySelfKeyframeCap`, `MemoryAlibiMatchRadius` |
| `trace.nim` | New event types: `llm_dispatched`, `llm_decision`, `llm_error`, `llm_layer_active`. Manifest gains `trace_settings.llm_compiled_in` / `.llm_layer_active` and `summary_counters.llm` (Sprint 1). Optional `llm_contexts/` dump (Sprint 5.1). Schema bumped to v3. |
| `tuning_snapshot.nim` | All 14 LLM/Memory tunables added (Sprint 5.4) so manifests carry the full LLM configuration. |
| `ffi/lib.nim` | `modulabot_enable_llm`, `modulabot_take_llm_request`, `modulabot_set_llm_response`, `modulabot_take_chat`, `modulabot_role`. Concurrency lives in the Python wrapper, not here. |
| `cogames/amongthem_policy.py` | `_AnthropicController` (default), `_OpenAIController` (Sprint 5.3 skeleton), `_build_llm_controller` selector. `AmongThemPolicy._executor` is a `ThreadPoolExecutor` with dispatch/gather phases (Sprint 4.1). Per-call-kind timeouts, retry/backoff, Anthropic tool-use. |

### 14.6 Open questions (Q-LLM1–Q-LLM9)

All open questions listed in `LLM_VOTING.md §12` were resolved during the
2026-04-30 Q&A pass and, where applicable, have been implemented. The two
that were provisional at design time:

- **Q-LLM1** — provider and model: **AWS Bedrock + Claude Sonnet 4.5** via
  `anthropic.AnthropicBedrock` in the Python wrapper. Direct Anthropic API
  is the fallback. Resolved in `cogames/amongthem_policy.py`.
- **Q-LLM6** — credentials: Bedrock credential chain (IAM role / env vars /
