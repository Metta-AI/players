## Modulabot type definitions.
##
## Phase 0 scope: every type the rest of the codebase will need to refer to
## *by name*. No procs, no business logic. The shape locked down here is
## what the per-module ports in phase 1 will fill in.
##
## Layout decisions are recorded in DESIGN.md §3. Notable conventions:
##
## - `Bot` is a thin envelope holding sub-records. Cross-cutting top-level
##   fields (`role`, `isGhost`, `frameTick`, `sim`, `paths`, `rngs`,
##   `sprites`) stay flat because every layer reads them.
## - Field names inside sub-records drop the prefix that became implicit
##   from the sub-record name. e.g. v2's `bot.taskHoldTicks` becomes
##   `bot.tasks.holdTicks`, `bot.imposterFolloweeColor` becomes
##   `bot.imposter.followeeColor`.
## - `voting` is a sub-record; the boolean that v2 called `bot.voting`
##   becomes `bot.voting.active`.
