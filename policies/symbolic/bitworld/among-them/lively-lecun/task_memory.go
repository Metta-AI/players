// TaskMemory tracks per-station belief about task assignment.
//
// For each station the agent carries one of three states plus a cumulative
// radar-hit count:
//
//	known    icon was seen near the station (definitely assigned)
//	maybe    no icon evidence (starting state); RadarHits gives a
//	         cumulative radar-based confidence score
//	seen_no  station center was in viewport for onScreenNoIconK consecutive
//	         frames without an icon nearby, OR we reached the station and
//	         completed / timed out / couldn't path to it
//
// Radar scoring (per tick): for each Maybe station, predict where its
// arrow would appear on this frame (PredictedArrow). If any detected
// arrow pixel is within radarMatchTol Chebyshev of the prediction,
// RadarHits[i]++.
//
// Goal selection (BestGoal): Known beats Maybe beats SeenNo. Within
// Maybe, pick the highest cumulative-hit tier gated at 80% of the top;
// break ties by manhattan distance. See
// docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-29-radar-hit-counting-design.md.
