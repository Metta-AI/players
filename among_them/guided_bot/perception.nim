## Perception pipeline orchestrator.
##
## One entry point — `perceive(frame) -> Percept` — that runs every
## phase's observations against a single unpacked frame and packages
## the results into a `Percept` value. `belief.updateBelief` merges
## the percept into the long-lived `Belief`.
##
## The pipeline is explicitly additive per phase: each sub-phase
## populates more fields of `Percept` than the previous. See
## DESIGN.md §15 for the full sub-phase plan.
##
## Phase 1.0 populates:
##   - `tick`
##   - `interstitial` (kind + black-pixel count)
##   - `ignoreMask`   (player-centre zone + radar colour; no per-sprite
##                     exclusions yet — those are stamped in the bot
##                     pipeline after the actor scan)
##
## Phase 1.3 adds:
##   - `actors`       (crewmates, bodies, ghosts, role, self-colour)
##                     via `perception/actors.scanAll`. The bot pipeline
##                     runs `scanAll` after localize (needs camera for
##                     future world-coord conversion) and stamps actor
##                     exclusions into the ignore mask.
##
## Phase 1.4 adds:
##   - `taskPercept`  (task-icon matches, radar-dot matches) via
##                     `perception/tasks.scanTasksAndRadar`. Runs after
##                     localize + actors; needs camera lock for task-icon
##                     scanning, radar dots are camera-independent.
